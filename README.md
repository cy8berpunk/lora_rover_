# Lora Rover 

The Lora Rover is a standard RC car equipped with an lora transmission module with which large distances can be overcome.
The range comes with one big disadvantage which is the low bandwith (300 kbps), which is also the challange since the controller only has limited information to operate, and barely no visual information such as video feed.

The system consists of multiple units, the rover itself, a base tranceiver and the web interface.
